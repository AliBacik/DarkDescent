3D Horror Game 
3D Psychological horror game. As a hotel employee trying to go from the 10th floor to the bottom floor, you will witness anomalies on the floor. It is a game that creates a tension-filled atmosphere while the player tries to get to the bottom floor by making the right choices.

### Game Mechanics and Story

-Turkish dubbing with AI empowered
-The player is an employee working at the hotel.

-While he was cleaning the last room in a room on the 10th floor, 
he received a phone call and learned that strange things were happening in the hotel, 
and he was called to the bottom floor.

-The player who is likely to encounter an anomaly on each floor should use the elevator behind him if he sees an anomaly,
or use the elevator in front of him if there is no anomaly.

-If he makes a mistake, he returns to the top floor. The anomalies the player will encounter are completely random and are renewed with every mistake.

-While it is possible that there is an anomaly, there is also the possibility that it is not. Thus, the player competes with his memory.
